####################
THIS IS MY APP IDEA
####################
The whitepaper#introduction is just examples,
it might look like this: whitepaper#Title and so on
I want it to be Security app it thought for my own personal for fun. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Type of Guide, Whitepaper

# Type of "Title" in the 'Guide'

# Number of Paragraphs [1],[2],[3]

# Number of lines of "text" in each Paragraph mentioned

# Number's of line becomes (code) and = AnswerInLetter. Now example

EXAMPLE:
#   whitepaper#introduction=Paragraph(1)=7lines=AnswerInLetter(alphabet)
#   whitepaper#introduction=Paragraph(2)=18lines=AnswerInLetter(alphabet)
#   whitepaper#introduction=Paragraph(3)=5lines=AnswerInLetter(alphabet)
#   whitepaper#introduction=Paragraph(4)=1lines=AnswerInLetter(alphabet)
#   whitepaper#introduction=Paragraph(5)=20lines=AnswerInLetter(alphabet)

##NOTE##
# Maybe times 4 since octothorpe is made up of 4 lines?
# so it will be "number of (lines)times 4 which gives 1-2 combined letters"
